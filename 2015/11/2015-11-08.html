<h3 id="performance-of-es5-getter-setter">Performance of ES5 getter/setter</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve been using Vue.js quite a lot lately so I&#39;m wondering if ES5 getter/setter are performance killers...</p>
<p>Tried a few benchmarks and it seems that <code>defineProperty</code> is safer than <code>get</code>/<code>set</code> on object literals. They are slower than normal properties but most of the time the performance is still in the same magnitude.</p>

</ul>
<p>All in all, it&#39;s all about if the getters/setters are inlined or not. If they are inlined, the performance won&#39;t be too far away from normal property definition. If they are not, it all depends on the context. I don&#39;t think those getters and setters created by data-binding frameworks will be simple enough to be inlined easily, nor do I think they wouldn&#39;t have a significant performance impact, but sacrifice this amount of performance for the powerful functionalities we want is still a fair trade. As long as these getters and setters are not called that frequently(like in each frame of an animation), they are not likely to be the performance bottleneck.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve noticed that the data-binding setup by Vue does cause some performance hits in my project(by looking at the CPU profile after notice the jagging during CSS animation), but I believe this problem is solvable since it&#39;s caused by <em>unnecessary</em> data-bindings that Vue setup for me. All I need to do is find a way to tell Vue to stop watching objects in my arrays(instead, just watch the arrays themselves). <code>track-by</code> is not meant for this since the watching is setup via the shared store pattern, not the data-binding to the DOM. I&#39;ve dug through the documentation(and used Google)but didn&#39;t find anything useful. Well...maybe it does exists and it&#39;s only me missing that one link I need...</p>
